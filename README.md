# Krunker Fluxon CSS
> A css built specifically for simplicity, style and clutter removal.
> 
This is your average CSS you can think of. It's been build as motivational project after older generation CSS, with goal of keeping simplicity and style.

## **This CSS Features:**
- A nice retouch to UI
  - Simplistic, but modern and stylish UI makes it look pretty to the eyes.
- De-cluttered menu
  - No more bloated to oblivion UI. Everything that's important is kept. If you feel like something you commonly use is missing, create a pull request with thing you need.
- Smaller elements
  - Krunker's recently been oversizing elements, while this CSS picks most optimal size.
- Documented Style Sheet
  - The worst enemy when it comes to modifying other's CSS is organization of everything. This CSS has identation and labels to explain what piece of code does what.
- Versatility
  - The CSS Contains `:root` code block that has many things to configure. Everyone may find their own configuration.
- Resolution support
  - *"if ur css depends on resolution you did it wrong" ~LukeTheDuke#7313.* Despite FHD resolution (1080p) being most commonly used, there are players and users who don't use FHD monitors. This CSS doesn't have any potential problems with resolutions and can be easily used on most *(if not, all)* monitors.
- UI Scale?
  - Recommended UI Scale is <0.8. Anything above that *may* cause UI Overlapping.
- Pull requests? Sure.
  - You can contribute to the CSS by opening pull requests to merge. Community ideas for this CSS become real!
